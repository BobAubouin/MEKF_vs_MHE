  abstract = {The purpose of this investigation was to describe the pharmacodynamic interaction between propofol and remifentanil for probability of no response to shaking and shouting, probability of no response to laryngoscopy, Bispectral Index (BIS), and electroencephalographic approximate entropy (AE).Twenty healthy volunteers received either propofol or remifentanil alone and then concurrently with a fixed concentration of remifentanil or propofol, respectively, via a target-controlled infusion. Responses to shaking and shouting and to laryngoscopy were assessed multiple times after allowing for plasma effect site equilibration. The raw electroencephalogram and BIS were recorded throughout the study, and AE was calculated off-line. Response surfaces were fit to the clinical response data using logistic regression or hierarchical response models. Response surfaces were also estimated for BIS and AE. Surfaces were visualized using three-dimensional rotations. Model parameters were estimated with NONMEM.Remifentanil alone had no appreciable effect on response to shaking and shouting or response to laryngoscopy. Propofol could ablate both responses. Modest remifentanil concentrations dramatically reduced the concentrations of propofol required to ablate both responses. The hierarchical response surface described the data better than empirical logistic regression. BIS and AE are more sensitive to propofol than to remifentanil.Remifentanil alone is ineffective at ablating response to stimuli but demonstrates potent synergy with propofol. BIS and AE values corresponding to 95\% probability of ablating response are influenced by the combination of propofol and remifentanil to achieve this endpoint, with higher propofol concentrations producing lower values for BIS and AE.},

  abstract = {Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic models are used to predict and explore drug infusion schemes and their resulting concentration profiles for clinical application. Our aim was to develop a pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic model for remifentanil that is accurate in patients with a wide range of age and weight.Remifentanil pharmacokinetic data were obtained from three previously published studies of adults and children, one of which also contained pharmacodynamic data from adults. NONMEM was used to estimate allometrically scaled compartmental pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic models. Weight, age, height, sex, and body mass index were explored as covariates. Predictive performance was measured across young children, children, young adults, middle-aged, and elderly.Overall, 2,634 remifentanil arterial concentration and 3,989 spectral-edge frequency observations from 131 individuals (55 male, 76 female) were analyzed. Age range was 5 days to 85 yr, weight range was 2.5 to 106\,kg, and height range was 49 to 193\,cm. The final pharmacokinetic model uses age, weight, and sex as covariates. Parameter estimates for a 35-yr-old, 70-kg male (reference individual) are: V1, 5.81 l; V2, 8.82 l; V3, 5.03 l; CL, 2.58 l/min; Q2, 1.72 l/min; and Q3, 0.124 l/min. Parameters mostly increased with fat-free mass and decreased with age. The pharmacodynamic model effect compartment rate constant (ke0) was 1.09 per minute (reference individual), which decreased with age.We developed a pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic model to predict remifentanil concentration and effect for a wide range of patient ages and weights. Performance exceeded the Minto model over a wide age and weight range.},

  abstract = {Background Pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) models are used in target-controlled-infusion (TCI) systems to determine the optimal drug administration to achieve a desired target concentration in a central or effect-site compartment. Our aim was to develop a PK\textendash PD model for propofol that can predict the bispectral index (BIS) for a broad population, suitable for TCI applications. Methods Propofol PK data were obtained from 30 previously published studies, five of which also contained BIS observations. A PK\textendash PD model was developed using NONMEM. Weight, age, post-menstrual age (PMA), height, sex, BMI, and presence/absence of concomitant anaesthetic drugs were explored as covariates. The predictive performance was measured across young children, children, adults, elderly, and high-BMI individuals, and in simulated TCI applications. Results Overall, 15 433 propofol concentration and 28 639 BIS observations from 1033 individuals (672 males and 361 females) were analysed. The age range was from 27 weeks PMA to 88 yr, and the weight range was 0.68\textendash 160 kg. The final model uses age, PMA, weight, height, sex, and presence/absence of concomitant anaesthetic drugs as covariates. A 35-yr-old, 170 cm, 70 kg male (without concomitant anaesthetic drugs) has a V1, V2, V3, CL, Q2, Q3, and ke0 of 6.28, 25.5, 273 litres, 1.79, 1.75, 1.11 litres min-1, and 0.146 min-1, respectively. The propofol TCI administration using the model matches well with recommendations for all age groups considered for both anaesthesia and sedation. Conclusions We developed a PK\textendash PD model to predict the propofol concentrations and BIS for broad, diverse population. This should be useful for TCI in anaesthesia and sedation.},

  abstract = {Various methods are nowadays available to design observers for broad classes of systems. Nevertheless, the question of the tuning of the observer to achieve satisfactory estimation performance remains largely open. This paper presents a general supervisory design framework for online tuning of the observer gains with the aim of achieving various trade-offs between robustness and speed of convergence. We assume that a robust nominal observer has been designed for a general nonlinear system and the goal is to improve its performance. We present for this purpose a novel hybrid multi-observer, which consists of the nominal one and a bank of additional observer-like systems, that are collectively referred to as modes and that differ from the nominal observer only in their output injection gains. We then evaluate on-line the estimation cost of each mode of the multi-observer and, based on these costs, we select one of them at each time instant. Two different strategies are proposed. In the first one, initial conditions of the modes are reset each time the algorithm switches between different modes. In the second one, the initial conditions are not reset. We prove a convergence property for the hybrid estimation scheme and we illustrate the efficiency of the approach in improving the performance of a given nominal high-gain observer on a numerical example.},

Although these pumps offer more accurate titration of intravenous drugs than is possible with simple boluses or constant rate infusions, the choice of the plasma as the target site is arbitrary. The plasma is not the site of drug effect for most drugs. This manuscript describes two algorithms for calculation of the infusion rates necessary for a computer-controlled infusion pump to rapidly achieve, and then maintain, the desired target concentration at the site of drug effect rather than in the plasma.},
