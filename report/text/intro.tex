This report details the pipeline for the comparison of the two methods to identify PD parameter from Propofol and Remifentanil using BIS as the measured signal. In order to have a fair comparison, this is done on simulated data, where the true parameters are known.\\

This report is organized as follow, Section~2 explain the method to generate the simulated data. Section~3 explain the details of the two proposed methods and the metrics used to evaluate the performances. The results are presented in section~4 and some conclusion are exposed in section~5.
