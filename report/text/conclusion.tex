In this report, three methods for the estimation of PD paramters during total intravaenous anesthesia have been proposed and compared. The first one is a Multiple Extended Kalman Filter with a Petri cost, the second one is a Multiple Extended Kalman Filter with a Narendra cost and the last one is a Moving Horizon Estimator. \medskip

The three methods have been tested on a database of 1000 simulated patients. At the end, the MEKF with the Narendra cost seems to be the best option. In fact, it has the lowest mean metrics value at the end of the simulation, the lowest standard deviation and also the lowest maximum value.\medskip

In the future this method will be used with an MPC to propose a closed loop control of the anesthesia. \medskip
